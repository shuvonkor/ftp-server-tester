How It Works:
Connect to the FTP Server: The script attempts to connect using the server address and optional port.
Login: It logs in with provided credentials, or anonymously if no username and password are supplied.
Directory Listing: If the connection is successful, it lists the directories in the root folder.
Error Handling: If any part of the connection or listing fails, it will output an error message.
